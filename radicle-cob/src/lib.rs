//! # Collaborative Objects
//!
//! Collaborative objects are graphs of CRDTs. The current CRDTs that
//! is intended to be used are specifically [automerge] CRDTs.
//!
//! The initial design is proposed at [RFC-0662], and this
//! implementation keeps to most of its design principle.
//!
//! ## Basic Types
//!
//! The basic types that are found in `radicle-cob` are:
//!   * [`CollaborativeObject`] -- the computed object itself.
//!   * [`ObjectId`] -- the content-address for a single collaborative
//!   object.
//!   * [`TypeName`] -- the name for a collection of collaborative objects.
//!   * [`History`] -- the traversable history of the changes made to
//!   a single collaborative object.
//!
//! ## CRU Interface (No Delete)
//!
//! The main entry for manipulating [`CollaborativeObject`]s is by
//! using the CRU like functions:
//!   * [`create`]
//!   * [`get`]
//!   * [`list`]
//!   * [`update`]
//!
//! ## Storage
//!
//! The storing of collaborative objects is based on a git
//! backend. The previously mentioned functions all accept a [`Store`]
//! as parameter. The `Store` itself is an accumulation of different
//! storage capabilities:
//!   * [`object::Storage`]
//!   * [`change::Storage`] -- **Note**: there is already an
//!   implementation for this for [`git2::Repository`] for convenience.
//!
//! ## Resource
//!
//! The [`create`] and [`update`] functions take a `Resource`. It
//! represents the type of resource the collaborative objects are
//! relating to, for example a software project.
//!
//! This `Resource` must implement [`identity::Identity`] to allow the
//! internal logic to reference the resource's content-address in
//! `git` as well as the stable identifier used for the resource.
//!
//! ## History Traversal
//!
//! The [`History`] of a [`CollaborativeObject`] -- accessed via
//! [`CollaborativeObject::history`] -- has a method
//! [`History::traverse`] which provides a way of inspecting each
//! [`Entry`] and building up a final value.
//!
//! This mechanism would be used in tandem with [automerge] to load an
//! automerge document and deserialize into an application defined
//! object.
//!
//! This traversal is also the point at which the [`Entry::author`]
//! and [`Entry::resource`] can be retrieved to apply any kind of
//! filtering logic. For example, a specific `author`'s change may be
//! egregious, spouting terrible libel about Radicle. It is at this
//! point that the `author`'s change can be filtered out from the
//! final product of the traversal.
